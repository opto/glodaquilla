    <br><b>Glodaquilla - NG </b>is an extension to Thunderbird which allows to control which accounts or 
    folders are included in Global Search and Indexing. Enhancing the standard operation, choices for account or 
    folder inclusion can be inherited/propagated to child folders.
    <br>
        Also adds three columns to the Thunderbird message pane that are useful to monitor downloaded messages (in IMAP, for example) 
        and/or are useful in debugging.
        <br>
 
    Created by R. Kent James (see bugzilla), updated to TB 60/78+ by Klaus Buecher/opto.<br>
<br>
Example: 

    <ul>
      <li> Display whether message has been fully downloaded (in an extra column, relevant for IMAP)
        <br /></li>
 
      <li> Local/private spam or draft or temporary folders and subfolders can be in/excluded from indexing and global search
        <br /></li>
      <li> Archive folders and subfolders or local copies can be ex/included in indexing and global search<br /></li>
      <li> Real useful tool to eliminate that nasty indexing from junk and temporary folders (user comment)</li>
      <li> If you have some IMAP folders with a lot of messages that you do not need to search, 
        this plugin will make Thunderbird run very very fast (user comment)<br />
      </li>
      <li> Display in an extra column whether message is to be indexed ("gloda-dirty")
        <br /></li>
        <li> Display in an extra column whether message has been indexed for search (if gloda-id is > 2, it cannot be indexed if = 2)
          <br /></li>
      </ul>

    <h2>More search expressions and quick search key</h2>
    <p>
      The other addon, <b>Expression Search NG</b>, adds a new search text box to the end of your quick search bar. Whatever phrase you enter
      is searched for in your currently selected folder's to/from/cc/subject fields. Notice that by default
      the body is not searched for your search phrase. If that results in too many matches,you can focus the search
      using "operators". Operators are just short words followed by a colon, such as "from:amazon.com".
    </p>

    Here are some examples:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><b>weekend plans</b></p>
        <p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for
          'weekend plans' in the <i>from</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>cc</i>, or <i>subject</i>
          fields.</p>
        <p>If "Act as normal filter" enabled, the "Sender", "Recipients", "Subject" and "Body" buttons will
          determine to search in which fields.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          <b>from:mike</b> or <b>f:mike</b>
        </p>
        <p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'mike' in the <i>from</i>
          field.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          <b>to:bill</b> or <b>t:bill</b>
        </p>
        <p>This expression searches all messages in the current folder or view for 'bill' in the
          <i>to</i> or <i>cc</i> fields of the message.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          <b>tonocc:bill</b> or <b>cc:tom</b> or <b>bcc:riddle</b>
        </p>
        <p>Like above, <b>tonocc</b> will search <i>to</i> field only, <b>cc/bcc</b> will search <i>cc/bcc</i> field
          only. Case insensitive.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          <b>only:tom</b> or <b>o:tom</b>
        </p>
        <p>Search for 'tom', and 'tom' should be the only recipients in <i>to</i> filed. Case insensitive.<br />
          Note: 'only:(tom or jerry)' will get message that <i>to</i> filed is 'tom' or 'jerry' only, while 'only:(tom
          and jerry)' will get nothing, please use 'only:(tom,jerry)' instead if you want to search emails that
          recipients contain and only contain both 'tom' and 'jerry'.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          <b>fromto:tom</b> or <b>ft:tom</b>

        </p>
      </li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Hot Key</h3>
    <p>
      By default, Press Ctrl+Shift+K, your cursor will appear in the expression search bar and
      you will be able to type.</p>
    <p>Expression Search add one additional hot key "Ctrl+B".</p>
    <p>Once you are typing in your search query, and you hit enter or otherwise let
      it begin searching, your cursor will remain inside of the query box to allow you
      to modify the query. However, if you'd rather go back to browsing your messages,
      instead of clicking on the message headers in your search results, you can just
      press 'ESC' to to clear the search criteria, and press 'ESC' again to refocus back</p>

    <h3>Quick Search Virtual Folder</h3>
    <p>If you haven't before used 'virtual folders' in Thunderbird, let me introduce them.
      This standard feature of Thunderbird lets you create a search, name it, and then
      have that name appear in your folders list. You can select that folder from the
      list and see the current result of the saved search. Note two useful things: 1)
      the 'contents' of the virtual folder can actually be in any of your real folders,
      and so a virtual folder actually can 'contain' messages that span many folders,
      and 2) the virtual folder's contents are recomputed each time you view it, so if
      you saved a virtual folder with 'sender' field containing 'Donald', then if you
      receive a new message from someone named Donald, it will be placed in your INBOX,
      but you'll immediately be able to switch to your Donald virtual folder, and find
      it there.</p>
    <p>So that's what regular virtual search folders do in Thunderbird. But this
      extension makes it extremely easy to create them. Now, when you normally hit
      'enter' in the Expression search quick search bar, you can instead hit
      'ctrl-enter' and a virtual folder called 'ExressionSearch' will be created (or modified
      if it already existed) to search for that search across ALL of your folders in the
      current account.</p>
    <p>The resulting virtual folder 'ExpressionSearch' can then be modified
      by editing properties, or can be renamed to make it a permanent virtual search folder.
      If you do not rename the folder, the next time you use ctrl-enter the ExpressionSearch
      virtual folder is reused to show your new quick search result.</p>

    <a name='keep_saved_search'></a>
    <p>The option "<b>Keep selected folders for saved search</b>" to have the "ExpressionSearch"
      virtual folder being persistent not only allows you to mark it as "Preferred" without
      the setting being lost when restarting TB, but also you can edit the properties of the
      "ExpressionSearch" virtual folder to specify once for all which of your physical folders
      should be searched or not with a global non-faceted search (CTRL+Enter).</p>
    <p>Where "ExpressionSearch" is created can also be set in the option dialog, By default, it's
      the root folder of the current disaplyed folder</p>
    <p>You can back to original folder by press Ctrl+Alt+LEFT</p>

    <h3>More complex searching</h3>
    <p>The quick search bar allows you use the simple expressions from above, but it also
      allows you to compose more complex searches. For instance, if you want to search for
      a message from Bob Barker to Dave Letterman about monologues, you can use:

    </p>
    <p><b>f:Bob Barker t:Dave Letterman s:monologues</b>
    </p>
    <p>If you are tired of getting results that have jokes about "Monica", you can instead use:

    </p>
    <p><b>f:Bob Barker t:Dave Letterman s:monologues -Monica</b>
    </p>
    <p>If you are interested in messages from either of these celebrities:

    </p>
    <p><b>f:Bob Barker or f:Dave Letterman</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Note 1: For the average user, the above information is usually adequate. If you
      are curious, this feature still relies upon an underlying Thunderbird message searching
      mechanism. That mechanism cannot always perform searches correctly that have a combination of boolean
      operators. So, if you try to perform a search that mixes "ands" and "ors" you may get back
      too many results. As an example, if you were to search for "t:dan and f:(bob or dave)" you
      will be mixing boolean operators and the results may be over inclusive or may work. As an extra technical
      note, if you did "t:dan and -f:(bob or dave)", DeMorgan's theorem takes place and you are actually
      composing a search of "t:dan and f:-bob and f:-dave".
    </p>
    <p>
      However, due to restrictions in Thunderbird's virtual search folder, the complex searching results maybe correct
      in your current search results, but maybe NOT in you search folder. as the search folder can only handle 'Match
      all'
      and 'Match any' types.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note 2: If you want search all folders using expression, you can create a virtual folder manually (Ctrl+Shift+F)
      with 'Match all messages',
      then using expression search in the virtual folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note 3: In case you also using the normal search filter, the final results is logically "AND", that means
      both filter are effective.

    <h3>Click 2 Search</h3>
    <p>
      If Enabled, you can use Ctrl/Shift+Right Click on sender/recipient/subject column to search for the same sender,
      recipient or subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="c2s_Replace"></a>
      For subject line, if provided regular expression match/replace patterns and enabled the replace for corresponding
      key combo, the pattern will be first executed
    <pre>Replace subject before search.
       Multiple matches are ORed. Example:
           Match:   \[#(\d*)\]
           Replace: $1
           Subject: [#1212][#2323]Some text
           Result:  (1212 or 2323)</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also common prefix like 'Re:', 'Fw:', [mail-list-name] will be removed before search.
    </p>
